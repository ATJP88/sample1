[200~Git is a freely available open-source system for distributed versioning. It is fast, scalable, and system version control (logging of adjustments) of files. As we know in the programming world while writing hundreds of codes there are always frequent changes happened. And these changes can be monitored and reversed with the help of GIT; further files can be made available to others via ‚Äúrepositories‚Äù or changes can be obtained from others.

If required, adjustments from publicly accessible repositories (repos) can be imported into a ‚Äúworking copy‚Äù or you can make your own adjustments available to others. This gives a programmer better control over each version of t

he file‚Äôs, complete history and track of changes done. This is all without any central server. It is an open-source, hence Git is also often used as a development platform, including for the Linux kernel.
